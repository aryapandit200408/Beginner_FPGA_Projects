## This is a repository showcasing my beginner verilog projects! 
In order to practice Verilog, I have implemented common combinational and sequential circuits using either gate-level, behavioral, or data-flow level modelling. I have used mostly Xilinx Vivado and have even tested out some of them in a BASYS-3 FPGA! <br>
Check them out and have a nice time!!! 

Here are some of the elaborated designs!
